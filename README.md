# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My solution
I learned how to make collapsible elements and got to practice for loops in JavaScript. 
What challanged me in this project were the images and their proper responsive sizing. 
I added a scroll bar for when the expanded answers would be too high, so the height of our component stays the same even when there is more  content expanded.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
